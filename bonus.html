<h1>Magenta Monkey</h1>
<body>
<p> 
    Monkey rides an astonishing skateboard into battle. He likewise has the power to levitate faster than the speed of sound, but using this power makes him gigantic for one week. 
    monkey has mastered the ability to tunnel through solid sand and he has the power to confuse the vision of a rival. Also, he possesses the power to spin like a whirlwind and he can sculpt and mold all rock with a thought, 
    however only while performing a series of gestures. Monkey owns a super ability to sense earthworm. Terribly, monkey is especially vulnerable to wood-based attacks.
